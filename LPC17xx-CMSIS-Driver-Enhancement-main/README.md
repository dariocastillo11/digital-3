# 📘 LPC17xx CMSISv2p00 Modernized Driver Library

A modern, well-documented, and thoroughly tested enhancement of the original `CMSISv2p00_LPC17xx` driver library for LPC176x/5x microcontrollers.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project aims to bring new life to the abandoned `CMSISv2p00_LPC17xx` driver library by:

- ✍️ Providing professional-grade documentation using **Doxygen**
- 🔧 Refactoring and extending existing driver **implementations**
- 📐 Standardizing **naming conventions** for consistency across modules
- 🧪 Introducing a **unit testing framework** for all functions (legacy, new, and modified)
- 🔄 Maintaining a **modern GitHub workflow** with issues, branches, and pull requests

Initially built for educational purposes in the course _Digital Electronics 3_ at FCEFyN, this project also serves as a robust, production-ready foundation for embedded development on the LPC17xx platform.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Modular and Consistent Drivers:** Improved APIs with reliable, easy-to-read code and consistent behavior across all modules.
- **Complete Test Coverage:** Each function is rigorously tested, including legacy code, with a minimal, self-contained test framework designed for on-board execution.
- **Doxygen Integration:** All modules are documented to support both learning and maintainability.
- **Developer-Friendly:** Naming schemes, macros, and defines follow strict conventions for clarity and scalability.
- **Actively Maintained:** Development is tracked through GitHub using collaborative tools such as issues, discussions, and pull requests.

## 🧪 Testing Framework

The project includes a lightweight, modular test framework:

- Designed to run directly on the target hardware
- Each function is tested individually in isolation
- Encourages test-driven development and safe contributions

---

## 🎓 Educational Context

In _Digital Electronics 3_, students:

- Start with low-level register programming on the LPC1769 (e.g., GPIO, PINSEL)
- Later transition to abstraction through this driver library
- Contribute to the library itself, learning collaborative software development

This project ensures the library is not only a usable HAL but also a **maintainable and extendable codebase** for students and professionals alike.

---

## 🔗 Companion Repository

A [companion repository](https://github.com/David-A-T-M/DigitalElectronics3_2025) is being developed alongside this one, providing:

- ✅ Example projects at **register-level** and using the **modern HAL**
- 📚 Guides and working examples for the **LPC1769** and **STM32 Blue Pill**
- 🔁 Migration paths between LPC and STM32, encouraging platform independence

The goal is to give students a clear, practical guide for real-world development across architectures.
